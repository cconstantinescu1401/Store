# Auction-house
The task invloved implementing a Java program for an online auction system.
The key functionalities of the program were:

 - The products currently on sale by the Auction House are stored in a list that Customers can view, Brokers can modify it by deleting products that have been sold, and Administrators can modify it by adding new products. These entities can work with the list at the same time.

 - Customers who want to bid for a product request this from the Auction House specifying the id of the desired product. The auction house randomly associates a Broker to each Client, and the Broker mediates the auction later.

For the Java program, I used all the OOP Concepts ,I implemented several design patterns(Command, Builder, Singleton, Factory), I made use of multithreading and generics, and, last but not least, I added a Javadoc for a better understanding of the code.
